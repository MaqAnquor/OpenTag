# OpenTag: an open-source alternative to Claude in Slack

Run your own AI agent inside Slack: it reads a thread, answers, calls your tools, and
renders rich results right in the conversation. Think of it as having Claude in your
workspace, except **open-source and self-hosted**: you own the runtime, bring your own
model, and wire it to your own tools. No per-seat pricing, no lock-in.

It's built on **[`@copilotkit/channels`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/packages/channels)** —
CopilotKit's open SDK for chat-platform agents (Slack first; the same code also runs on
Discord, Telegram, and WhatsApp). Clone it, point it at your model and tools, and you own
the whole stack.

▶️ **[Watch the demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a74fa1cb-add0-463e-a23c-aa09b95d5135)** (~50s) — a KiteBot agent working a Slack thread: it renders a breakdown, a table, and a bar chart inline (**generative UI**) and files a ticket only after an **Approve** gate (**human-in-the-loop**).

> **Two ways to run it:** **host it on your own** with the open-source SDK below — or skip the ops and **[sign up for the managed service →](https://go.copilotkit.ai/opentag-managed-gh)** coming soon from CopilotKit. The managed service will be part of our Enterprise Intelligence platform. You'll be able to use our cloud-hosting or enterprises can host it on their own infra.

> Note: the **Intelligence Gateway** mode below is part of "host it on your own" — you run that
> process yourself and bring your own CopilotKit Intelligence project. It's distinct from the
> fully-hosted **managed service** above, which is still on the waitlist.

## Quick start

OpenTag's packages are published on npm — a standalone `pnpm install` in this repo pulls in
everything you need, no monorepo required.

You'll run two processes: the **agent backend** (`pnpm runtime`) and **the bot**. For the bot,
pick one of two modes:

- **Intelligence Gateway — recommended.** `pnpm channel` runs the bot over the CopilotKit
  Intelligence Realtime Gateway. This process never holds a Slack token — Intelligence owns
  the Slack edge — so there's less for you to run and secure. You still run this process
  yourself and bring your own CopilotKit Intelligence project — it's not the fully-hosted
  managed service described below.
- **Self-hosted.** `pnpm dev` (or `pnpm start`) runs the bot locally and talks to Slack (and
  Discord/Telegram/WhatsApp) directly with your own platform tokens.

Both modes talk to the same agent backend over AG-UI.

### The packages

OpenTag is a thin layer on top of a handful of CopilotKit packages. The `pnpm install` in step 3 installs all of them for you — this is what each one does, so you know what you're running and which ones are optional.

**Required** — every OpenTag install needs these four:

| Package | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`@copilotkit/channels`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/packages/channels) | The platform-agnostic bot engine — threading, tool calls, the human-in-the-loop gate. |
| [`@copilotkit/runtime`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/packages/runtime) | The AG-UI agent backend that runs your LLM and tools. |
| [`@copilotkit/channels-ui`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/packages/channels-ui) | Cross-platform JSX for rich messages (Block Kit on Slack, Components V2 on Discord, HTML on Telegram). |
| [`@copilotkit/channels-slack`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/packages/channels-slack) | The Slack adapter — or swap it for the platform you're targeting (below). |

**Optional** — add only what you use:

| Package | When you need it |
| --- | --- |
| [`@copilotkit/channels-discord`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/packages/channels-discord) · [`-telegram`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/packages/channels-telegram) · [`-whatsapp`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/packages/channels-whatsapp) | Running on a platform other than Slack — one adapter per platform. |
| [`@copilotkit/channels-intelligence`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/packages/channels-intelligence) | Runs the bot over the CopilotKit Intelligence Realtime Gateway instead of holding platform tokens — see `app/managed.ts`. |

**1. Create a Slack app.** At [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1) →
*From a manifest* → paste [`slack-app-manifest.yaml`](./slack-app-manifest.yaml). Install it,
then grab the **Bot User OAuth Token** (`xoxb-…`) and an **App-Level Token** (`xapp-…`, with the
`connections:write` scope) — needed for self-hosted mode, or to register the app with your
CopilotKit Intelligence project for Intelligence mode. Step-by-step in
[setup.md](./setup.md#1-create-a-slack-app).

**2. Set your secrets** in `.env` (`cp .env.example .env`):

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...      # the agent runs on OpenAI's Responses API (required for web search)

# Self-hosted mode:
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...

# Intelligence Gateway mode — full list in .env.example:
INTELLIGENCE_GATEWAY_WS_URL=wss://...
INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY=cpk-...
INTELLIGENCE_ORG_ID=org_...
INTELLIGENCE_PROJECT_ID=...
INTELLIGENCE_CHANNEL_ID=channel_...
```

**3. Run it:**

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm runtime    # the agent backend, on :8200

pnpm channel    # recommended — the bot over the Intelligence Gateway
# or
pnpm dev        # alternative — the bot, self-hosted
```

**4. Talk to it.** @mention the bot in any channel thread:

> @KiteBot summarize this thread and file it as a bug

That's the whole loop. To wire up Linear, Notion, inline charts, or to run
on Discord / Telegram / WhatsApp, see **[setup.md](./setup.md)**.  

We won't lie to you, though. Setting up hosting for chat agents is not easy. To skip all of that heartache, go [join the waitlist](https://go.copilotkit.ai/opentag-managed-gh) for the CopilotKit managed service as part of our Intelligence platform, both cloud-hosted or self-hosted.

## Make it your own

OpenTag is deliberately small and hackable:

- **Change what it does.** The agent's behavior is steered by a single system prompt in
  [`runtime.ts`](./runtime.ts) — rewrite it and you have a different agent.
- **Copy `app/` to start your own bot.** It's the platform-agnostic bot (tools, components, the
  human-in-the-loop gate). `runtime.ts` is the agent backend: one CopilotKit `BuiltInAgent` (an
  LLM + optional MCP tools — no Python, no LangGraph), served over AG-UI.
- **One platform, or all of them.** `createBot` takes an array of adapters; set the secrets for
  whichever platform(s) you want and the bot starts an adapter for each.

The full architecture, the file-by-file map, and every integration live in
**[setup.md](./setup.md)**.

## Deep research (LangGraph deep agent)

`agent/` is an alternative agent backend to `runtime.ts` — a Python
[`deepagents`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents) (LangGraph) planner with a virtual
filesystem and OPTIONAL Tavily web research, served over AG-UI on `:8123`. Instead of a single
system-prompted LLM call, it plans with `write_todos`, reads/writes its own virtual files, and
(when configured) researches the web before synthesizing an answer — while still calling
KiteBot's forwarded generative-UI tools like the TS runtime does.

Only `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required. `TAVILY_API_KEY` is **optional** — without it, chat and UI
generation still work (the agent answers from its own knowledge); with it, live web research
turns on.

To run it:

```bash
cd agent && uv sync   # requires uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/
pnpm agent            # cd agent && uv run python main.py — serves over AG-UI on :8123
                       # (port from SERVER_PORT/PORT env, default 8123)
```

Then point the bot at it instead of `runtime.ts` by setting in `.env`:

```bash
AGENT_URL=http://localhost:8123/
```

With `agent/` in the mix, the local setup is now three pieces: the deep-research agent
(`pnpm agent`, `:8123`), the bot (`pnpm channel` or `pnpm dev`), and whichever brain
`AGENT_URL` points at — the Python deep agent above, or the TS `runtime.ts` (`pnpm runtime`,
`:8200`) as before. `agent` and `runtime` are alternative brains for the same bot; run one or
the other depending on what `AGENT_URL` targets.

## Don't want to host it yourself?

Self-hosting means you run and scale the runtime, persistence, and inspection tooling yourself.
A **managed CopilotKit service** is on its way. It's the same agent, without the ops: durable
threads, persistence, hosted inspection, and agents that improve from feedback (**Continuous
Learning from Human Feedback**).
