// KiteBot on CopilotKit Intelligence — one-click Railway topology.
// Three services build from this repo; the Python agent uses rootDirectory "agent".
// Inter-service URLs use Railway reference variables (${{svc.VAR}}), resolved at
// deploy over private networking. SECRETS are declared with preserve() so applying
// never clobbers deployer-set values — set their actual values in the Railway UI
// (see README "Deploy to Railway").
//
// Two topology invariants this file encodes:
//   1. Ports are pinned as explicit service variables (NOT left to Railway's
//      auto-injected $PORT) so each service's listen port and the ${{svc.PORT}}
//      its peers dial always agree.
//   2. Services reached over Railway private networking must bind :: (all
//      interfaces) — private DNS (RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN) resolves to IPv6, and
//      legacy environments are IPv6-only. A service bound to 127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0
//      is unreachable by its peers.

  // the agent dial that same variable. We also set NOTION_MCP_HOST=:: so the
  // sidecar binds all interfaces (its upstream default is 127.0.0.1, which is
  // unreachable across containers on the private network).
  //
  // Notion is an OPTIONAL research source: the agent runs fine (chat + UI + web
  // research) without it and drops the Notion tools if this sidecar is
  // unreachable. But if you deploy this service it REQUIRES NOTION_TOKEN and
  // NOTION_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN — its launcher exits non-zero without them. To skip
