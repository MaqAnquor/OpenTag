/**
 * Starts the official Notion MCP server as a Streamable-HTTP sidecar for the
 * agent backends — the TS runtime (`runtime.ts`) and the Python deep-research
 * agent (`agent/`); on Railway the Python agent is the sole consumer (see
 * `.railway/railway.ts`). Run with `pnpm notion-mcp`.
 *
 * Why a launcher instead of a raw npm script: the two `.env` values need to be
 * mapped to the two DIFFERENT things the Notion server expects — the Notion
 * integration secret (`NOTION_TOKEN`) becomes the OUTBOUND `Authorization:
 * Bearer` the server sends to Notion's API (passed via `OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS`,
 * see below), and `NOTION_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` becomes the server's INBOUND HTTP
 * transport bearer (`AUTH_TOKEN` / `--auth-token`) that the agent presents to
 * reach this sidecar. Doing the mapping here works identically on
 * Windows/macOS/Linux without shell-specific env interpolation.
