from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

# Imported at module top-level (not inside test functions) so that agent.py's
# module-level load_dotenv() runs exactly once, at collection time, before any
# test mutates os.environ. build_agent() reads os.environ at call time, so no
# reload/re-import is ever needed - re-importing later would just be a no-op
# (Python caches modules in sys.modules), but doing it here makes that
# explicit and guarantees these tests are order- and .env-independent: a
# developer's local agent/.env cannot repopulate a key a test just deleted.
#
# NOTE: `main` is intentionally NOT imported here. Unlike agent.py (whose
# module-level code only calls load_dotenv()), main.py's module-level code
# eagerly calls build_agent() and re-raises on failure. Importing it at
# collection time would require a real OPENAI_API_KEY to already be present
# in the environment (before any test's monkeypatch.setenv runs), which
# breaks collection on a clean checkout with no .env and no key exported.
# So `import main` stays function-scoped in test_health_ok, after the
# OPENAI_API_KEY monkeypatch.setenv below - same as before this fix.
